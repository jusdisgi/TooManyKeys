# Too Many Keys
Soon to be renamed*

This is a 54-key, ergonomic split keyboard with a few tricks. Some of the features include:
- 1.69in color [LCD screen](https://www.waveshare.com/product/displays/lcd-oled/lcd-oled-3/1.69inch-lcd-module.htm)
- Per-key LEDs, using [WS2812B-2020](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4684)
- A roller encoder based on [CKW12](https://github.com/kumamuk-git/CKW12/tree/main) by Kumamuk, but integrated into the main PCB
- Kailh [PG1316S](https://holykeebs.com/products/kailh-pg1316s-butterfly-switch-10-pack) ultra-low profile switches
- A totally absurd [battery](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/maker-emporium-ltd/PIS-1131/13283430) to run all of this stuff...5Ahr!!

## Work in Progress
